# Online-Machine-Learning-Notes
*Continous stream of data*
***

## When to use?
- Online (continuous streaming) machine learning is the opposite of batch (all data are available from the start) learning.
- As describe in the River project, use online learning if:
  - You want a model that can learn from new data without having to revisit past data.
  - You want a model which is robust to concept drift.
  - You want to develop your model in a way that is closer to what occurs in a production context, which is usually event-based.
